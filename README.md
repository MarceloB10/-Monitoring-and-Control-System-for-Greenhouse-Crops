# Monitoring and Control System for Greenhouse Crops

This work proposes a system to manage the variables of cultivation in green-houses. This system can control and monitor crops using IoT devices; it analyzesthe data from sensors and makes predictions using artificial intelligence.  Thesystem uses several sensors and actuators to measure environmental variablesand make decisions using the acquired data.  These measurements and the userinteractions  travel  through  a  broker  employing  ESP8266  NodeMCU  modulesconnected trough Wi-Fi using the MQTT protocol for data transmission.  Thesystem also consists of a web application that connects to the broker to sendsignals to the actuators and receive data from the sensors.  This web applicationreads, stores, and displays real-time data in a graphical user interface.  This toolincludes an LSTM recurrent neural network and a Transformer Model to obtainrelevant predictions based on the data collected over time.
